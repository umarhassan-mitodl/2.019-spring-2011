Topics Overview
---------------

[Lecture notes](#Selected_Lecture_Notes)

on selected topics are listed by session in the table below.

Lecture notes for sessions 17-26 are not available.

### Ship Lines and Hydrostatics

The lectures start with an introduction of basic naval architectural concepts. Terminology and methods for generating ship lines are presented. A presentation on the general characteristics of ocean systems is given followed by a specific presentation on FPSOs. Ship hydrostatics is reviewed and stability analysis is explained. Righting arm curves and other similar concepts are presented both for intact and damaged stability. The use of criteria for the stability assessment is also discussed.

### Ship Structures

One lecture is given on the structural analysis of ships. First, general concepts are taught such as the mechanics of beams, torsion of closed shafts, and elastic stability of columns. Then, a ship structural analysis follows, including the calculation of loads, shear forces, bending moments, and buckling. The development of a midship section is also taught.

### Ocean Environment

Three lectures are devoted to this subject. First, there is a discussion of the kinematics and dynamics of regular waves, then a description of irregular wave and wave spectrum of irregular seas. Short-term statistics of ocean waves are studied for applications to the design of ships and offshore structures.

### Seakeeping

Four lectures are given on this subject, which is critical to the description of the dynamic behavior of floating structures in waves. The basic formulation for the radiation, diffraction problems are given. Characteristics of the added mass and damping coefficients are discussed. A long-wave approximate solution for the diffraction problem is derived and used to illustrate the characteristics of wave excitations. The equation of motion is given. The RAO of a floating body is derived in terms of the basic hydrodynamic coefficients. The spectrum of the body response in irregular waves is given. The influence of resonant frequencies on the motion of a floating body in an irregular sea is discussed. The numerical boundary element method for the sea-keeping computation is briefly explained.

### Drift and Slowly-Varying Loads/Motions

3-4 lectures are given on this subject. The basic nonlinear mechanisms for drift loads/motions and slowly-varying loads/motions are explained. The characteristics of drift and slowly-varying loads/motions and its implications to the design of floating structures and mooring systems are then discussed. Approximate formulas for the evaluation of slowly-varying loads/motions are provided.

### Mooring Dynamics and Design

3-4 lectures are given on this subject. The basic dynamics of a catenary mooring line are first introduced. An analytic solution for the static analysis is given. The general procedure in mooring system design is taught. A sample mooring design is discussed.

### Manufacturing

Two lectures are devoted to this subject. The basic requirements and procedures in the fabrication and installation of ships and marine structures are discussed. Ways in which to improve the efficiency of fabrication are also discussed.

### Advanced Topics

These topics are chosen by the students based on their interest in ocean science, naval architecture, and offshore structures. The advanced topics are not needed in order to carry out the design project for this course. Sample topics that might be discussed include the design and operation of autonomous underwater vehicles, wave impact and ship slamming, or structural integrity of pipelines and risers. The fundamentals, analysis tools, and existing research and development issues for these topics are given.
